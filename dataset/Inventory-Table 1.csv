12,,Melissa Gallo,"Generally: We've gotta support more transit-oriented development, along high transit corridors, particularly in under valued areas. We also have to continue to support mixed-use development. Allowing commercial spaces in residential buildings can help subsidize the rent of lower-income units.
We also HAVE to start putting resources INTO nonprofit and community development corporations (CDC's). There are a ton of them in Miami, most of which suffer from lack of resources and capacity to be able to compete with the big guys. Instead of advocacy on a project-by-project basis, focus should be to proactively push for influx of resources for CDC's.
Aside from this - we have to do better at coalition building and getting political buy-in. With that, we can explore mandatory things like mandatory inclusionary zoning & community benefits agreements (where you condition zoning approvals on community approval). Without political buy-in... only money talks. You have to find a way to incentivize the for-profit developer to want to do this. Tax breaks? Parking waivers? Expedited zoning approvals for developers that commit to affordability?

Like Leah Weston and Melissa Gallo mentioned earlier, Miami-Dade County is pre-empted (not allowed) from doing much in terms of regulating short-term rentals. This means that companies like Airbnb and Homeaway would need to voluntarily agree to address their impacts on housing affordability. One such solution that is being explored, is engaging these companies and asking them to seek a nominal nightly fee (just $1!!) per listing.",Y,C,,https://www.facebook.com/groups/100greatideas/permalink/1507414946015959/,,,,N,Y,airbnb,private business,,,,,,,

Teacher salary is abysmally low in Florida, and no where is the problem of affordable housing worse than in Miami. As part of my work with P.S. 305, I've interviewed dozens of public school teachers. In almost every single meeting, teacher pay is mentioned as a reason that teachers might have to leave the profession or the city.
San Francisco has an innovative ""Teacher Next Door"" program we could replicate! 
""The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) administers the Teacher Next Door (TND) Program to assist educators employed with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) with the purchase of their first home in San Francisco. TND funds can be used for down payment and closing costs to purchase a below market rate (BMR) or a market rate unit in conjunction with any other subordinate financing as long as the borrower meets all used program qualifications. The term of the TND is 10 years. There is no interest, nor shared appreciation. After the 5th year, the loan is forgiven at rate of 20% per year, and at the end of the 10th year, the loan is forgiven in its entirety.""",Y,OP,http://sfmohcd.org/teacher-next-door-program-tnd,https://www.facebook.com/groups/100greatideas/permalink/1507357846021669/,,,,Y,Y,first time home buyers,,,,,,,,

I can't help but think about the fact that even if these units would be more ""affordable,"" the individuals who are actually cost-burdened would not be first on the list to get their hands on these rentals.
How do we ensure that folks who need affordable housing get priority in new mixed-income developments? Especially in areas like Downtown that have better-than-average public transportation options.
