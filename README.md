# New Web Platform for Radical Partners Non-Profit 

  This stand-alone tool provides an improved user interface for community members to communicate and discuss ideas to create meaningful legislative and social change.  Users contribute to the website by logging in through Facebook or Google, which allows them to network and invite others to the discussion without the complications of directly using a Facebook group.  Users then click on specific topics that interest them and can view posted ideas in a featured, popular, or recent order. Data about posts - including likes, dislikes, reports, and topics - are added in real-time to a database. This aggregated data can then be used to efficiently create reports after the 5 day campaign.
